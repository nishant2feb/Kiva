```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```



```{r libraries, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

Loan = read.csv("kiva_loans.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)

## Overview of Loan data

We will overview the loan data and create a summary by loan dataframe to better analyse the data on country basis.
```{r Cleaning data, echo=FALSE}
summary(Loan)

summary_by_country = Loan %>%
  group_by(country)%>%
  summarise(no_loan = n(), LoanAmount = sum(loan_amount))

summary_by_country = summary_by_country%>%
  arrange(no_loan)

summary(summary_by_country)

```

## Analysing data grapically with each quartiles

```{r Correlation plot, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary_by_country%>%
  filter(no_loan <= 363)%>%
ggplot(aes(x = no_loan, y = LoanAmount, col = country, size = 10, alpha = 0.4))+
  geom_point(show.legend = F)+
  theme_classic()

summary_by_country%>%
  filter(no_loan <= 2313)%>%
  filter(no_loan > 363)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = no_loan, y = LoanAmount, col = country, size = 10, alpha = 0.4))+
  geom_point(show.legend = F)+
  theme_classic()

summary_by_country%>%
  filter(no_loan <= 6687)%>%
  filter(no_loan > 2313)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = no_loan, y = LoanAmount, col = country, size = 10, alpha = 0.4))+
  geom_point(show.legend = F)+
  theme_classic()

summary_by_country%>%
  filter(no_loan > 6687)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = no_loan, y = LoanAmount, col = country, size = 10, alpha = 0.4))+
  geom_point(show.legend = F)+
  theme_classic()


```

## Text Analysing

We will analyse activity text to get a overveiw for the general purpose of the loan. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
## Analysing data of text like sector activity and use
library(qdap)
library(tm)
library(wordcloud)

# Creating clean corpus
activity_text = VectorSource(Loan$activity)

activity_text = VCorpus(activity_text)

tm_map(activity_text, removeNumbers)
tm_map(activity_text, removePunctuation)

activity_text_tdm = TermDocumentMatrix(activity_text)

activity_text_matrix = as.matrix(activity_text_tdm)

freq = rowSums(activity_text_matrix)

#Word fequency for plotting data

word_freq = data.frame(term = names(freq), num = freq)

wordcloud(word_freq$term, word_freq$num, colors = 'red')

```

##Analysing Philippines Loan Data

When we looked into the fourth quartile the `phillippines` stand clearly as a outlier so lets take a deeper look into the data of `phillippines`.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

Loan_PH = Loan%>%
  filter(country_code == "PH")

summary(Loan_PH$loan_amount)

Loan_PH%>%
  ggplot(aes(sector, loan_amount))+
  scale_x_discrete("Sectors")+
  scale_y_discrete("Loan Amount")+
  stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom = "bar", fill = "grey50")+
  theme_classic()
  
```


Lets deep dive into the data.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

Loan_PH%>%
  select(loan_amount, date, sector)%>%
  ggplot(aes(loan_amount, date))+
  geom_point()+
  facet_grid(.~ sector)+
  scale_y_discrete(breaks = NULL)+
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = NULL)
  theme(axis.ticks.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.y = element_blank())

```

Graphically we can identify few outliers in few sectors and if compared with previous bar plot then can see the density distribution of loan amount in few sectors.

Like looking at wholesale sector we can easily see that the amount is highest but the distribution is done in larger chunks.

**Lets look at the data of wholesale sector.**

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
